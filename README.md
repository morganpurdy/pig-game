# Pig game

## Description
I coded parts of this game as part of the Udemy course I am taking called 'The Complete Javascript Course'. It is a dice game where there are two players who alternate rolling dice to get to a certain score to win. There is functionality of rolling dice, holding to keep your score, and starting a new game when you are done.

Following along, I learned about and implemented querySelectors, complicated functions, declaring variables outside of functions and loops.

## What I did
A lot of the game was pre-coded, including the structure of the game and a lot of the CSS. However, per challenges that are a part of the course, I added several features in the Javascript. First, I added the step that when a player rolls two sixes in a row, they lose their entire score. (As opposed to the functionality that I wrote as part of a tutorial, and not on my own, of the player losing their turn when they rolled a one). This code isn't in the project as it competes with a later challenge I implemented.

The part I am most proud of that I added is the input field and update button that can be used to change the winning score. The default is 100 points, but the players can change the winning score by entering it in the input field and hitting the update button or hitting 'enter'. I also added the line at the top to show the score needed to win, which updates to reflect the user's entry.

The final challenge had me add an additional dice. The original tutorial started out with one. To finish this project I added a second dice and made sure the functions account for the value of the second dice.

To wrap up the project, I did style it differently and add some design touches to practice HTML/CSS more and so I feel more like I can claim it as my own. I have included what the original game looked like, as Original.jpg.
